# CodeArena
Idea Brief
Overview:
CodeArena is a gamified online platform that offers coding challenges for developers to practice programming, compete with peers, and track their performance. The platform includes real-time code execution, progressive challenges, leaderboards, and a secure execution environment.

This one-week plan focuses exclusively on developing the complete frontend interface using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Monaco Editor. The goal is to have a fully navigable, interactive, and styled application with mocked data simulating backend behaviors.

Objective:
To build the user interface and functionality of the CodeArena platform including authentication flow, routing, challenge listing, code editor integration, and leaderboard UI.

Target Users:

Computer science students

Competitive programmers

Coding interview aspirants

Self-taught developers

Bootcamp attendees

Key Features to Build:

Authentication (Login, Register)

Protected and Public Routes

Dashboard with Challenge Cards

Monaco Editor Integration

Challenge View Page with Test Cases

Leaderboard Page

Tailwind-based Responsive Design

Daily Development Plan (Frontend Only)
Day 1: Project Setup and Routing
Goals:

Initialize project using Vite + React + TypeScript

Configure Tailwind CSS for styling

Set up React Router for public and protected routes

Create basic file structure: pages, components, contexts, utils, hooks

Implement AuthContext with mock authentication flow

Build ProtectedRoute and PublicRoute components

Expected Output:

App shell with working navigation and conditional rendering based on auth state

Day 2: Home, Login, and Register Pages
Goals:

Design and build the Home page with branding and call to action

Implement Login and Register pages using custom reusable Input and Button components

Validate form inputs and update authentication context

Add visual feedback: error messages, loading indicators

Make all pages responsive

Expected Output:

Fully functional authentication flow with mocked login state and navigation

Day 3: Dashboard and Challenge Cards
Goals:

Design and build the Dashboard page

Import and display challenges using mockChallenges.ts

Create filter and search bar for challenge listing

Build ChallengeCard component showing title, tags, and difficulty badge

Add interactivity and hover animations

Expected Output:

Dashboard page with dynamic list of challenges based on difficulty and tags

Day 4: Challenge Page with Monaco Editor
Goals:

Integrate Monaco Editor into Challenge view

Layout the challenge screen with two sections:

Left: Problem description, input/output sections

Right: Monaco Editor with Run and Reset buttons

Display mock output and test case results

Add Tabs or Accordions for "Input", "Output", "Test Cases", and "Hints"

Ensure mobile compatibility with collapsible sections

Expected Output:

Fully styled and interactive challenge screen with code editor functionality

Day 5: Leaderboard Page and Theming
Goals:

Build Leaderboard page showing ranks, usernames, and scores

Highlight logged-in user in the list

Sort leaderboard based on scores (mock data)

Apply consistent theming across pages

Finalize global components (Toast, Layout, Theme toggle if time permits)

Expected Output:

Fully functional and visually appealing leaderboard integrated into the application

Day 6: Final Touches, Testing, and Polish
Goals:

Conduct cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Ensure mobile responsiveness on small screen devices

Add loading spinners, skeleton loaders, and error fallback UIs

Clean up unused code and optimize performance

Record video walkthrough explaining routing, pages, and features

Expected Output:

Stable, responsive frontend codebase ready for backend integration

Day 7: Buffer and Final Submission
Goals:

Buffer time to accommodate delays or feedback

Incorporate mentor feedback if received earlier

Final deployment preview (if applicable)

Submit frontend code repository, walkthrough video, and documentation

Expected Output:

Complete frontend-ready UI with mock functionality, hosted preview link, and clean handoff

Technology Stack
Frontend:

React (with Vite + TypeScript)

Tailwind CSS

React Router v6

Monaco Editor

React Context API

Design and UI Principles:

Mobile-first responsive design

Modular reusable component-based structure

Visual feedback (loading states, toasts)

Consistent color scheme and layout structure

Learning Outcomes
Mastery of React functional components and hooks

Proficiency in TypeScript and type-safe frontend logic

Integration of Monaco Editor and custom components

UI/UX design using Tailwind CSS

Implementation of protected routes and auth-based UI logic

Preparing and documenting a complete capstone project
