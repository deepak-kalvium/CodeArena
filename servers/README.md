Submissions
POST /api/submissions â€” Submit a new solution to a challenge

Users (if registration is handled here)
POST /api/users/register â€” Register a new user (if applicable)

POST /api/users/login â€” Authenticate user and return JWT (planned for future if not present yet)

ðŸŸ¡ PUT APIs
These APIs are used to update existing resources.

PUT endpoints are not explicitly mentioned in your API doc, but based on CRUD operations and REST conventions, here are common expected routes:

Challenges
PUT /api/challenges/:id â€” Update a specific challenge

Users
PUT /api/users/:id/profile â€” Update user profile or stats (e.g., bio, country, preferences)

Submissions
PUT /api/submissions/:id â€” Update an existing submission (e.g., re-evaluate, update status)
